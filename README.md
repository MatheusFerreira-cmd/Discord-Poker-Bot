# Discord-Poker-Bot
A simple poker dealer bot for discord

# Credentials
In order to run the bot you first need to create a new application in discord site, set the permissions, vinculate with a server and then copy the credentials. Aiming to connect your local bot to the discord server, you need to have the Secret Token (just like a password to your bot log in)

So, after cloning the github repository, you need to create a file named "credentials.py", inside the file, you will only have the variable "discordToken" that contains the string of your secret token
